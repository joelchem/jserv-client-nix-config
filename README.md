# JServ Client
This repo contains NixOS configs for machines that connect as clients to my JCloud network.

JCloud is a virtual network spanning my personal servers and cloud VMs. One machine hosts the network; the rest connect as clients.

Use these configs to set up any NixOS system as a JCloud client.
